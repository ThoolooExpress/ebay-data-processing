Ebay data processing project for Database Systems, Fall 2018, Fordham University

## Initializing ##

Make sure that all the desired JSON files are in a directory called ebay_data in
the project root, then run the init.sh script.  The database will be generated
in a directory called tmp in the project root.

## Directory Structure ##

All (non-shell) source code is in src/py or src/sql, raw JSON data is in
ebay_data, and the database is placed in the tmp directory.

## Documentation ##

A description of each of the constraints implemented can be found in
constraints.md
